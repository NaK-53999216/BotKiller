# BotKiller Manifesto

BotKiller is a peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol for sovereign, anonymous AI.

This is not another “platform.” This is a refusal.

## The Mission

BotKiller exists to strip AI power from Big Tech.

We are ending the era where corporations own your data, rent you access to intelligence, and decide what your AI can or cannot say.

AI must be:

- Private by default
- Permissionless to use and build
- Unstoppable to censor

## A New Economy (Not Just Code)

BotKiller is not just a protocol — it is a job market.

It creates a specialized global workforce built around two roles:

### Workers (Miners)

Workers provide compute power to the network.

- They execute tasks.
- They return outputs.
- They are compensated by demand.

### Auditors (Brokers)

Auditors specialize in categories (domains, safety constraints, logic, factuality, or any verification specialty required by the market) and verify AI outputs.

- They stake to qualify.
- They validate results.
- They create an economic cost to fraud.

This is how BotKiller scales: compute is abundant, and trust becomes a profession.

## The Dual-Token Engine

BotKiller separates everyday usage from long-term value capture.

### Credits (Utility)

Credits are the user-facing utility for daily tasks. They are designed for predictable access and affordability.

### BOKI (Value Capture)

BOKI is the network’s value-capture currency. It aligns Workers, Auditors, builders, and supporters behind the growth and security of the protocol.

Credits are for consumption. BOKI is for ownership of the network’s upside.

## Privacy and Permissionlessness

In BotKiller’s P2P network, participation does not require permission.

Your interactions are designed to be private by default — not harvested, sold, or weaponized by centralized gatekeepers.

## Origin of the Name: BotKiller

BotKiller is not just a name — it is a destiny.

Centralized AI “bots” survive on control: gated access, closed infrastructure, and artificial scarcity.

BotKiller is built to break that control by forming a permissionless grid of Workers (miners) and Auditors (brokers) who coordinate compute and verification without gatekeepers.

This is economic war. As the protocol grows, closed systems become economically unviable: they cannot compete with a global market of decentralized labor and verification.

In the end, only the decentralized survives. BotKiller feeds on the old world to build the new one, getting stronger as its competitors fail.

## BEWARE OF IMPOSTERS

As BotKiller grows, greedy copies will emerge.

These clones are driven by selfish profit and lack our decentralized soul.

Authentic support happens ONLY through this protocol and the verified contract:
