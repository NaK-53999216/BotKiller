# BotKiller Manifesto

BotKiller is a peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol for sovereign and anonymous AI.

We believe AI should be:

- Sovereign: running under the user’s control, not rented at the mercy of centralized platforms.
- Anonymous by default: identity is not a prerequisite for participation.
- Permissionless: anyone can join, build, verify, and contribute.

## The Protocol

BotKiller coordinates a decentralized network of nodes that provide AI execution, routing, and verification.

The protocol is designed so that no single entity controls:

- who can access the network,
- which models can be served,
- how pricing evolves,
- or how verification is performed.

## Two-Currency Model: Coin A and Coin B

BotKiller’s economics separate *usage* from *network growth*.

### Coin A: user cost

Coin A is the user-facing unit of account for consuming AI services through BotKiller (requests, inference, routing, storage, bandwidth, etc.). Users care about predictable and low costs.

### Coin B: network growth

Coin B is the network-growth token. It aligns long-term incentives for:

- node operators,
- builders,
- auditors (“fiscals”),
- and the broader ecosystem.

The key mechanism is:

- When Coin B grows in value and distribution, the network can subsidize, optimize, and expand capacity.
- This growth lowers the effective cost of usage in Coin A.

In short:

- Coin B grows the network.
- Network growth makes Coin A cheaper for users.

## Auditors (“Fiscals”) and Staking

BotKiller supports organizations that want to act as independent auditors (fiscals).

Auditors stake Coin B to signal commitment and to create measurable cost for dishonest behavior. Staking is a simple on-chain primitive that can be extended over time into richer verification, reputation, and slashing mechanisms.

## Principles

- Privacy is a feature, not an afterthought.
- Participation must not require permission.
- Resilience beats convenience.
- Incentives must favor users and network longevity.

## The Mission

BotKiller exists to enable a future where AI is:

- free to run,
- hard to censor,
- and economically driven by the network, not by gatekeepers.
